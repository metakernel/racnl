The "Rust Abstract Common Native Library" is a thin interface for common operations across different OS. It is used in the XGrapes GUI framework for its cross platform capability.

The goal with RACNL is to provide a fine grained control over operations accross a wide range of devices & operating systems while keeping an easier native access.
